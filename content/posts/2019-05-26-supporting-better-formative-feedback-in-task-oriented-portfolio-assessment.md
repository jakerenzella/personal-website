Within the Task-Oriented Portfolio Assessment Model,  the need for teaching staff to provide frequent formative feedback is essential.

In this paper, we reflect upon the use of task-oriented portfolio assessment in supporting introductory programming units and propose some methods to measure and improve quality, as well as decrease time required to provide formative feedback. 

Furthermore, we explore how the Doubtfire Learning Management system is currently supporting this approach, and provide prospective improvements & research for such systems.
